This solution streams the input once, builds per-(claim_id, status_code) graphs incrementally, and detects cycles using a bounded, non-recursive, pruning DFS.
It avoids storing full paths and enforces simple cycles only.
It processed ~11M lines in ~6 minutes.
Future work includes parallelizing per-graph processing and pruning graphs below the global longest cycle.
See README.md for more detail.
